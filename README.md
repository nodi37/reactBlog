# reactBlog

Just another blog app, this is my second project i made from scratch. Frontend is written in React framewrok, backend is in Node.js. I had just basic knowledge about React when i started to build this, so i didn't even know that there is something like Redux. The point was to learn more about React and JWT. It's not probably even good. I should build some Protected route component or something but I wanted to finish this asap and start to build something new. I just wanted to check how React works! But it works and I think that there is even some styled component inside! It's hosted here: [blog.nbtb.eu](https://blog.nbtb.eu). 

## Summary

- Frontend is using React
- Backend is using Node.js
- CSS is still bad but with Grid :D
- JWT is implemented somehow

### Some npm packages

- html-react-parser
- jwt-decode
- react-animations
- react-image-file-resizer 
- react-quill
- react-router-dom
- styled-components
- bcrypt
- body-parser
- cors
- express
- jsonwebtoken
- mongoose

### Others 

- It allows to add, edit, delete, publish post.
- [Quilljs](https://quilljs.com/) as text editor.
- I don't remember but images are probably compressed on client side, they are saved in Base64 encoding in database. <- Bad solution

# And that's all here one more time...

This is just trash now. I will not come back here :)
